## 📌 Background & Overview  
### 🧩 Project Context

A **global e-commerce company** faced challenges in **targeting customer segments effectively**. The Marketing team wanted to reward loyal customers and identify those with high potential. However, customer segmentation was still done **manually in Excel**, which was **time-consuming** and **insufficient** for **large-scale strategy**.

To solve this, I developed a RFM (Recency – Frequency – Monetary) analysis using Python. The solution empowers the Marketing team to launch **data-driven, personalized campaigns, prioritize high-value users, and improve retention.**

### Objective:
### 📖 What is this project about? What Business Question will it solve?

This project uses Python to segment customers using the RFM (Recency – Frequency – Monetary) model and answers:

- 🔍 Who are the company’s most **valuable and loyal customers**?
- 🚨 Which customers are likely to **churn or need re-engagement**?
- 📣 How can we **optimize marketing campaigns** and **resource allocation** based on customer value?

🎯 The goal is to generate **actionable customer segments** that guide strategic **decisions in marketing, loyalty programs, and resource allocation**.

### 👤 Who is this project for?  

💼 **Marketing & CRM Teams:** improving campaign precision and retention strategies

📊 **Data Analysts:** exploring behavior-driven segmentation

🧭 **Business Decision Makers:** planning resource allocation based on customer value
